<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project




Welcome to BioBot!

BioBot is a biology study app built using Swift and SwiftUI. This app is designed to help students learn and review important concepts from Duquesne University's Biology 1 and 2 courses.

One of the features of BioBot is a vocabulary word guessing game, which allows students to test their knowledge of key terms and definitions. In addition to this, BioBot also includes a chat bot that uses the ChatGPT API to answer questions about biology. This chat bot is a great resource for students looking to get quick and accurate answers to their questions, or for those who simply want to learn more about the subject.

Whether you're a student looking to ace your biology exams, or just someone interested in learning more about the subject, BioBot is the perfect tool for you. So give it a try and see how much you can learn!
